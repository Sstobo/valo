					<h2>LED Street Lights</h2>
					<p>VALO has a wide range of LED street lights to meet each city’s requirements. Street lights are available in a variety of wattages and luminous efficiencies, and include surge protection devices. VALO offers LED street lights for both horizontal and vertical installations.</p>

						<h3>LED Lighting</h3>
						<p>can be applied to streets, roads, highways, bridges, and parking garages. LED street lights have a wide range of benefits since they are highly effective, long lasting, and durable. The main advantages of LED street lights include:</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-lighting">
						<h3>Low Energy Costs</h3>
						<p>LED street lights use 50% to 70% less energy, and provide more brightness, than traditional High-Intensity Discharge (HID) lights. They have a long lifespan and can be used for at least a decade.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-lighting">
						<h3>Low Maintenance Costs</h3>
						<p>Due to their longevity, LED street lights are not costly to maintain since replacing street lights is expensive and inconvenient. Additionally, LED lights are shock-proof, and produce less heat than traditional lighting resulting in less wear.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-lighting">
						<h3>Improved Quality of Light</h3>
						<p>LED street lights are brighter than HID lights, and provide uniform light which improves visibility. Fewer LED lights are needed to offer the same brightness provided by many fluorescent lights.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-lighting">
						<h3>Environmentally Friendly</h3>
						<p>LED street lights are free of hazardous chemicals such as mercury and led, and they significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. LED lights do not emit a lot of heat, and can be properly disposed of to reduce toxic waste.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-lighting">
						<h3>Crime Reduction</h3>
						<p>The improved quality of light given by LED street lights can help to reduce criminal activity. Criminals often target poorly lit areas, and thus LED lighting can act as a criminal deterrent.</p>
