					<h2>LED Street Lights</h2>
					<p>VALO has a wide range of LED street lights to meet each city’s requirements. Street lights are available in a variety
						of wattages and luminous efficiencies, and include surge protection devices. VALO offers LED street lights for both
						horizontal and vertical installations.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="product-lighting-flex-container">
					<div class="product-lighting">
						<h3>LED Lighting</h3>
						<p>can be applied to streets, roads, highways, bridges, and parking garages. LED street lights have a wide range of benefits
							since they are highly effective, long lasting, and durable. The main advantages of LED street lights include:</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-lighting">
						<h3>Low Energy Costs</h3>
						<p>LED street lights use 50% to 70% less energy, and provide more brightness, than traditional High-Intensity Discharge
							(HID) lights. They have a long lifespan and can be used for at least a decade.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-lighting">
						<h3>Low Maintenance Costs</h3>
						<p>Due to their longevity, LED street lights are not costly to maintain since replacing street lights is expensive and
							inconvenient. Additionally, LED lights are shock-proof, and produce less heat than traditional lighting resulting
							in less wear.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-lighting">
						<h3>Improved Quality of Light</h3>
						<p>LED street lights are brighter than HID lights, and provide uniform light which improves visibility. Fewer LED lights
							are needed to offer the same brightness provided by many fluorescent lights.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-lighting">
						<h3>Environmentally Friendly</h3>
						<p>LED street lights are free of hazardous chemicals such as mercury and led, and they significantly reduce greenhouse
							gas emissions. LED lights do not emit a lot of heat, and can be properly disposed of to reduce toxic waste.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-lighting">
						<h3>Crime Reduction</h3>
						<p>The improved quality of light given by LED street lights can help to reduce criminal activity. Criminals often target
							poorly lit areas, and thus LED lighting can act as a criminal deterrent.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section class="controller">
					<h2>Street Light Controller + Hub</h2>
					<p>VALO’s street light controller enables LED street lights to become an intelligent network which connects to sensors,
						remote devices, and cell phones. The controller provides centralized controls, and can be remotely upgraded and programmed.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="controller-drop-down">

					<h3>Controller Configurations</h3>
					<div class="sub-title-blue-line">
					</div>
					<p class="products-configuration-blurb">VALO’s optional light controller hub provides hard-wire connectivity on each street light via four ports. The patented
						controller allows external sensors and devices to be easily installed into the network, and is ideal for devices with
						Power over Ethernet (PoE) connections. VALO offers a variety of sensor configurations depending on needs and requirements.
						Common setups include the following:</p>
