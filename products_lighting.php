						<h3>LED Lighting</h3>
						<p>can be applied to streets, roads, highways, bridges, and parking garages. LED street lights have a wide range of benefits since they are highly effective, long lasting, and durable. The main advantages of LED street lights include:</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-lighting">
						<h3>Low Energy Costs</h3>
						<p>LED street lights use 50% to 70% less energy, and provide more brightness, than traditional High-Intensity Discharge (HID) lights. They have a long lifespan and can be used for at least a decade.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-lighting">
						<h3>Low Maintenance Costs</h3>
						<p>Due to their longevity, LED street lights are not costly to maintain since replacing street lights is expensive and inconvenient. Additionally, LED lights are shock-proof, and produce less heat than traditional lighting resulting in less wear.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-lighting">
						<h3>Improved Quality of Light</h3>
						<p>LED street lights are brighter than HID lights, and provide uniform light which improves visibility. Fewer LED lights are needed to offer the same brightness provided by many fluorescent lights.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-lighting">
						<h3>Environmentally Friendly</h3>
						<p>LED street lights are free of hazardous chemicals such as mercury and led, and they significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. LED lights do not emit a lot of heat, and can be properly disposed of to reduce toxic waste.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="product-lighting">
						<h3>Crime Reduction</h3>
						<p>The improved quality of light given by LED street lights can help to reduce criminal activity. Criminals often target poorly lit areas, and thus LED lighting can act as a criminal deterrent.</p>

					<h2>Street Light Controller + Hub</h2>
					<p>VALO’s street light controller enables LED street lights to become an intelligent network which connects to sensors, remote devices, and cell phones. The controller provides centralized controls, and can be remotely upgraded and programmed.</p>
